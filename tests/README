The cURL Test Suite

Requires:
  perl (and some shell tools that still hasn't been written in pure perl)

Run:
  'make test'. This invokes the 'runtests.sh' shell script. Edit the top
  variables of that script in case you have some specific needs.

  The script breaks on the first test that doesn't do OK. Run the script
  with -v for more verbose output.

Logs:
  All logs are generated in the logs/ subdirctory (it is emtpied first
  in the runtests.sh script)

Data:
  All test-data are put in the data/ subdirctory.

  For each tests there exist four files. Replace N with the test number:

    nameN.txt: test description as displayed when run

    commandN.txt: command line options for this test

    httpN.txt: the full dump of the HTTP protocol communication that curl is
               expected to use when performing this test

    replyN.txt: the full dump the server should reply to curl for this test.
               If the final result that curl should've got is not in this
               file, you can instead name the file replyN0001.txt. This enables
               you to fiddle more. ;-)

FIX:

  * Make httpserver.pl work when we PUT without Content-Length:
