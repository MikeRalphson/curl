.SH NAME
ares_dup \- Duplicate a resolver channel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <ares.h>
.PP
.B int ares_dup(ares_channel *\fIchannel\fP, ares_channel \fIsource\fP)
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBares_dup(3)\fP function duplicates an existing communications channel
for name service lookups.  If it returns successfully, \fBares_dup(3)\fP will
set the variable pointed to by \fIchannel\fP to a handle used to identify the
name service channel.  The caller should invoke \fIares_destroy(3)\fP on the
handle when the channel is no longer needed.

The \fBares_dup_options\fP function also initializes a name service channel,
with additional options set exactly as the \fIsource\fP channel has them
configured.
