.TH ARES_SAVE_OPTIONS 3 "1 June 2007"
.SH NAME
ares_save_options \- Save configuration values obtained from initialized ares_channel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <ares.h>
.PP
.B void ares_save_options(ares_channel \fIchannel\fP, struct ares_options *\fIoptions\fP, int *\fIoptmask\fP)
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBares_save_options(3)\fP function saves the channel data identified by
.IR channel ,
into the options struct identified by
.IR options ,
and saves the mask of options which are set to the integer
pointer (passed by reference) identified by
.IR optmask .

The resultant options and optmask are then able to be
passed directly to ares_init_options.  When the options
are no longer needed, ares_destroy_options should be called
to free any associated memory.
.SH NOTE
Since c-ares 1.6.0 the ares_options struct has been "locked" meaning that it
won't be extended to cover new funtions. This function will remain
functioning, but it can only return config data that can be represented in
this config struct, which may no longer be the complete set of config
options. \fBares_dup(3)\fP will not have that restriction.
