This is what's new and changed in the c-ares 1.5.3 release:

 o fix adig sample application compilation failure on some systems
 o fix pkg-config reporting of private libraries needed for static linking
 o fallback to gettimeofday when monotonic clock is unavailable at run-time

Thanks go to these friendly people for their efforts and contributions:

 Brad House, Yang Tse
 and obviously Daniel Stenberg

Have fun!
