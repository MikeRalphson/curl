This is what's new and changed in the c-ares 1.5.4 release:

 o improved configure detection of several functions
 o improved source code portability
 o adig supports a regular numerical dotted IP address for the -s option
 o handling of EINPROGRESS for UDP connects
 o supports the glibc "rotate" resolv.conf option (or ARES_OPT_ROTATE)
 o added the new function ares_gethostbyname_file()
 o bugfix in ares_parse_ptr_reply() which would cause a buffer to shrink
   instead of expand if a reply contained 8 or more records
 o buildconf works on OS X

Thanks go to these friendly people for their efforts and contributions:

 Yang Tse, Charles Hardin, Carlo Contavalli, Brad Spencer, Gerald Combs
 and obviously Daniel Stenberg

Have fun!
