This is what's new and changed in the c-ares 1.6.1 release:

Changed:

 o in6_addr is not used in ares.h anymore, but a private ares_in6_addr is
   instead declared and used
 p ares_gethostbyname() now supports 'AF_UNSPEC' as a family for resolving
   either AF_INET6 or AF_INET

Fixed:

 o ares_parse_*_reply() functions now return ARES_EBADRESP instead of
   ARES_EBADNAME if the name in the response failed to decode

Thanks go to these friendly people for their efforts and contributions:

 Phil Blundell, Japheth Cleaver

Have fun!
