This is what's new and changed in the c-ares 1.6.1 release:

Changed:

 o in6_addr is not used in ares.h anymore, but a private ares_in6_addr is instead
   declared and used

Fixed:

 o ares_parse_*_reply() functions now return ARES_EBADRESP instead of
   ARES_EBADNAME if the name in the response failed to decode

Thanks go to these friendly people for their efforts and contributions:

Have fun!
