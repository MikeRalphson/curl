 o fixed undefined return value in init_by_resolv_conf() function for windows
 o added ares_parse_ns_reply()
 o fix failure to get the search sequence of /etc/hosts and DNS from
   /etc/nsswitch.conf, /etc/host.conf or /etc/svc.conf when /etc/resolv.conf
   did not exist
 o when domains were sert in the options struct, and there were domain/search
   entries in /etc/resolv.conf, the domains of the options struct would be
   overridden
