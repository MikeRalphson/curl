This package is built on ares 1.1.1 by Daniel Stenberg. I've decided to put
together and release my own ares archives since the ares maintainer doesn't
want these improvements.

Changes made to ares 1.1.1 included in this package:

- James Bursa made it run on RISC OS

- Dominick Meglio made it run fine on NT4

- Duncan Wilcox made it work fine on Mac OS X

- Daniel Stenberg adjusted the windows port

- liren at vivisimo.com made the initial windows port
