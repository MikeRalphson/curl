This package is built on ares 1.1.1 (written by Greg Hudson). I've decided to
put together and release my own ares archives since the ares maintainer
doesn't want these improvements.

The package is called 'arescurl' for now since I (Daniel Stenberg) want this
for use within the curl project. If you can think of a better and more witty
name, please speak up.

Version 1.0 (8 October 2003)

- James Bursa made it run on RISC OS

- Dominick Meglio made it run fine on NT4

- Duncan Wilcox made it work fine on Mac OS X
