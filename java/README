                                Java Interface

 This is not a complete implementation of a libcurl interface. I've made the
core work and it needs additional code to be added to get the rest of the
stuff supported.

 The interface is not set yet, bring your suggestions!

 Feel free to grab the source files in here and help out!

 The 'test.java' is the actual program that uses the curl stuff.
