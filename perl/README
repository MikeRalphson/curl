Perl

 Perl's a great script language, not the least for quick prototyping. Curl is
elegantly used from within it. You can either invoke external curl command
line or use the curl interface.

 Georg Horn's Perl interface to curl is available in the Curl_easy/
subdirectory. Using the Curl::easy module is just straightforward and
works much like using libcurl in a C programm, so please refer to the
documentation of libcurl. Have a look at test.pl to get an idea of how
to start.
