Perl

 Perl's a great script language, not the least for quick prototyping. Curl is
elegantly used from within it. You can either invoke external curl command
line or use the curl interface.

 Georg Horn's Perl interface to curl is available in the Curl_easy/
subdirectory.

 Unfortunately, we don't have any examples nor any documentation for it at
this point.
