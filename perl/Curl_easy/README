README for Perl extension Curl::easy.

The perl module Curl::easy provides an interface to the cURL library "libcurl".
See http://curl.haxx.se/ for more information on cURL and libcurl.

This module requires libcurl and the corresponding headerfiles to be
installed. You then may install this module via the usual way:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you have an older version of libcurl, you can remove 'curlopt-constants.c' 
and have it rebuilt by 'perl Makefile.PL'.

You can also do this for a later version of libcurl, except currently
you will have to update the module EXPORTS list manually.

The module provides the same functionality as libcurl provides to C programs,
please refer to the documentation of libcurl. Some examples may be found in
t/*.t.
