README for Perl extension Curl::easy.

The perl module Curl::easy provides an interface to the cURL library "libcurl".
See http://curl.haxx.se/ for more information on cURL and libcurl.

This module requires libcurl and the corresponding headerfiles to be
installed. You then may install this module via the usual way:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

The module provides the same functionality as libcurl provides to C programs,
please refer to the documentation of libcurl.

A short example how to use the module may be found in test.pl.
