Revision history for Perl extension Curl::easy.
Check out the file README for more info.

1.0.2  Tue Oct 10 2000:
    - runs with libcurl 7.4
    - modified curl_easy_getinfo(). It now calls curl_getinfo() that has
      been added to libcurl in version 7.4.

1.0.1  Tue Oct 10 2000:
    - Added some missing features of curl_easy_setopt():
      - CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER now works by passing the name of a perl
        variable that shall be crated and the errormessage (if any)
	be stored to.
      - Passing filehandles (Options FILE, INFILE and WRITEHEADER) now works.
    Have a look at test.pl to see how it works...

    - Added a new function, curl_easy_getinfo(), that for now always
      returns the number of bytes that where written to disk during the last
      download. If the curl_easy_getinfo() function is included in libcurl,
      (as promised by Daniel ;-)) i will turn this into just a call to this
      function.

1.0  Thu Oct 5 2000:
    - first released version
    - runs with libcurl 7.3
    - some features of curl_easy_setopt() are still missing:
      - passing function pointers doesn't work (options WRITEFUNCTION,
	READFUNCTION and PROGRESSFUNCTION).
      - passing FILE * pointers doesn't work (options FILE, INFILE and
	WRITEHEADER).
      - passing linked lists doesn't work (options HTTPHEADER and
	HTTPPOST).
      - setting the buffer where to store error messages in doesn't work
	(option ERRORBUFFER).
