cURL (as of 7.9.1) builds completely OOTB. The Cygwin specific files
(README is the only one so far) are located in a non-standard location:
 <srctop>/packages/Cygwin/

This release (v7.9) includes the patch needed in CYGWIN-PATCHES,
however future releases should eliminate this directory.


Direct Dependencies:
  OpenSSL 0.9.6b

Canonical Homepage:
  http://curl.haxx.se/

Canonical Download:

Build Instructions:

  unpack curl-<ver>-X-src.tar.bz2
  cd curl-<ver>
  ./configure --prefix=/usr 
  make
  (optionally) make test (*)
  make install (**)

  (*) until v7.9.1, 'make test' requires Cygwin's mounts set to binmode / Unix
  (**) if you need to bootstrap, make install will require libtool 1.4.3
       (which contains a patch related to the ".exe" extension on curl.exe
