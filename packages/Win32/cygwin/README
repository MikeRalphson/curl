Curl is a tool for transferring files with URL syntax, supporting
 FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, GOPHER, TELNET, DICT, FILE and LDAP. 
 Curl supports HTTPS certificates, HTTP POST, HTTP PUT, FTP uploading, kerberos,
 HTTP form based upload, proxies, cookies, user+password authentication, 
 file transfer resume, http proxy tunneling and a busload of other useful tricks.
 See /usr/doc/curl-<version>/FEATURES for more info.

cURL (as of 7.9.1) builds 100% cleanly OOTB.

The Cygwin specific source files (README and a Makefile for
 building binary tarballs) are not in a CYGWIN-PATCHES directory.
 They are at: <srctop>/packages/Win32/cygwin/


Direct Dependencies:
  OpenSSL 0.9.6b (cURL can be built without SSL support: configure --without-ssl)


Canonical Homepage:
  http://curl.haxx.se/


Canonical Download:
  http://curl.haxx.se/download.html


Build Instructions:
  Download the source, move it to a location of your choosing, and then:

  $ tar xjf curl-<ver>-X-src.tar.bz2
  $ cd curl-<ver>-X
  $ ./configure --prefix=/usr 
  $ make
  $ make test    # optional, requires perl
  $ make install # (*)

  (*) LibTool 1.4.2 had a bug related to cygwin's use of ".exe" extensions,
      such that "make install" blew up at curl.exe. See this URL for details:
        http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/libtool/2001-September/005549.html
      The copy of ltmain.sh that is distributed with cURL includes this patch.


Packaging Instructions:
  To create a new binary tarball for cygwin's setup.exe, you must first do a clean
  build (see above). The 'make install' step is optional of course. Then do:

  $ cd curl-<ver>-X
  $ CYGBUILD=X make cygwinbin

  where "X" is the cygwin release number (e.g. the "-1" in curl-7.9.3-1).
  I had some difficulty figuring out how to default CYGBUILD to "1", this may
  get fixed in a future release.

  Assuming everything worked properly, you'll find your cygwin
  binary tarball in the curl-<ver>-X/packages/Win32/cygwin/ directory.
