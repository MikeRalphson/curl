.TH curl_easy_perform 3 "1 Mar 2001" "Curl 7.0" "libcurl Manual"
.SH NAME
curl_easy_perform - Do the actual transfer in a "easy" session
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/easy.h>
.sp
.BI "CURLcode curl_easy_perform(CURL *" handle ");
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function is called after the init and all the curl_easy_setopt() calls
are made, and will perform the transfer as described in the options.
It must be called with the same
.I handle
as input as the curl_easy_init call returned.

You are only allowed to call this function once using the same handle. If you
want to do repeated calls, you must call curl_easy_cleanup and curl_easy_init
again first.
.SH RETURN VALUE
0 means everything was ok, non-zero means an error occurred as
.I <curl/curl.h>
defines. If the CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER was set with
.I curl_easy_setopt
there will be a readable error message in the error buffer when non-zero is
returned.

.SH BUGS
Surely there are some, you tell me!
