EXAMPLES

This directory is for tiny libcurl programming examples. They are meant to
show some simple steps on how you can build your own application to take full
advantage of libcurl.

If you end up with other small but still useful example sources, please mail
them for submission in future packages and on the web site.

There are examples for different languages and environments. Browse around to
find those that fit you.
