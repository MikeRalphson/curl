.SH NAME
curl_multi_fdset - extracts file descriptor information from a multi handle
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLMcode curl_multi_fdset(CURLM *multi_handle,
                           fd_set *read_fd_set,
                           fd_set *write_fd_set,
                           fd_set *exc_fd_set,
                           int *max_fd);

.SH DESCRIPTION
This function extracts file descriptor information from a given multi_handle.
libcurl returns its fd_set sets. The application can use these to select()
on. The \fIcurl_multi_perform(3)\fP function should be called as soon as one
of them are ready to be read from or written to.

You should also be aware that when doing select(), you should consider using a
rather small (single-digit number of seconds) timeout and call
\fIcurl_multi_perform\fP regularly - even if no activity has been seen on the
fd_sets - as otherwise libcurl-internal retries and timeouts may not work as
you'd think.
.SH RETURN VALUE
CURLMcode type, general libcurl multi interface error code. See
\fIlibcurl-errors(3)\fP
