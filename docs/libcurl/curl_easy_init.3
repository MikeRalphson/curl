.SH NAME
curl_easy_init - Start a libcurl easy session
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>

.BI "CURL *curl_easy_init( );"

.SH DESCRIPTION
This function must be the first function to call, and it returns a CURL easy
handle that you must use as input to other easy-functions. curl_easy_init
initializes curl and this call \fBMUST\fP have a corresponding call to
\fIcurl_easy_cleanup(3)\fP when the operation is complete.

If you did not already call \fIcurl_global_init(3)\fP, it will be done
automatically with a default setup when you call \fIcurl_easy_init(3)\fP.
This may be lethal in multi-threaded cases, since \fIcurl_global_init(3)\fP is
not thread-safe and must not be called more than once (or from more than one
thread). You are strongly adviced to not rely on this automatic behaviour, but
call \fIcurl_global_init(3)\fP yourself properly.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If this function returns NULL, something went wrong and you cannot use the
other curl functions.
