.SH NAME
curl_multi_perform - add an easy handle to a multi session
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLMcode curl_multi_perform(CURLM *multi_handle, int *running_handles);
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
When the app thinks there's data available for the multi_handle, it should
call this function to read/write whatever there is to read or write right
now. curl_multi_perform() returns as soon as the reads/writes are done. This
function does not require that there actually is any data available for
reading or that data can be written, it can be called just in case. It will
write the number of handles that still transfer data in the second argument's
integer-pointer.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
CURLMcode type, general libcurl multi interface error code.

NOTE that this only returns errors etc regarding the whole multi stack. There
might still have occurred problems on invidual transfers even when this
function returns OK.
.SH "TYPICAL USAGE"
Most application will use \fIcurl_multi_fdset\fP to get the multi_handle's
file descriptors, then it'll wait for action on them using select() and as
soon as one or more of them are ready, \fIcurl_multi_perform\fP gets called.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
