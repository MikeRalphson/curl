README.win32

  Read the README file first.

  Curl has been compiled, built and run on all sorts of Windows and win32
  systems. While not being the main develop target, a fair share of curl users
  are win32-based.

  Some documentation in this archive will be tricky to read for Windows
  people, as they come in unix-style man pages. You can either download a
  freely available nroff binary for win32 (*pointers appriciated*), convert
  the files into plain-text on your neighbor's unix machine or run over to the
  curl web site and view them as plain HTML.
