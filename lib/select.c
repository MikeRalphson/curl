/* Winsock and TPF sockets are not in range [0..FD_SETSIZE-1] */

/*  There are various ways to wait for a socket to be ready to give or take
 *  data.  None of them are perfect.  
 *
 *  select() is available everywhere, but cannot take a file
 *  descriptor numerically greater than FD_SETSIZE but cannot be reliably
 *  interrupted by a signal.
 *
 *  pselect() works with signals, but still has the file descriptor problem.
 *  And some older systems don't have it.
 *
 *  poll() (and equivalently on Windows, WSAPoll()) can take any file
 *  descriptor, but has the signal problem.  And some older systems
 *  don't have it.
 *
 *  The signal issue is this:  We would like to be able to avoid the
 *  wait if a signal has arrived since we last checked for it.  All
 *  these methods terminate the wait (with EINTR) if a signal arrives
 *  while the waiting is underway, so it's just signals that happen
 *  shortly before the wait that are a problem.  With pselect(), this
 *  is possible because it has the ability to simultaneously unblock
 *  signals _after_ the wait begins.  So you just block signals, then
 *  check for arrival, then assuming no signals have arrived, call
 *  pselect() with an argument that says to unblock signals.  Any
 *  signal that arrived after you blocked will thus interrupt the wait
 *  and pselect() returns immediately.
 * 
 *  Curl_pselect() is our compromise among these.  We use poll()
 *  whenever it is available and select() otherwise.  We emulate
 *  pselect-like signal behavior by unblocking signals just before
 *  calling poll() or select() and re-blocking after.  This only
 *  _approximates_ pselect(), because there is a window in which a
 *  signal may arrive and we wait anyway.
 *
 *  To reduce that window, we use pselect(), if it is available --
 *  with no file descriptors -- just before the poll() or select() in
 *  order to detect signals that arrived between when the caller
 *  blocked signals and when he called Curl_pselect().
 *
 *  Curl_select() is for callers who want us to ignore caught signals and
 *  wait until a socket is ready or the timeout expires.  We implement that
 *  simply as a loop around Curl_pselect().
 *
 *  There is a way to add signal interruptibility to poll(), which we
 *  don't provide today: Let caller give us a file descriptor to add
 *  to our list of wait-for-readable file descriptors.  Caller passes
 *  us the fd of a pipe.  He doesn't block signals and his signal
 *  handler writes to the other end of that pipe.  Therefore, a signal
 *  causes poll() to return, even if received before poll() was
 *  called.
