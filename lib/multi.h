/*
  This is meant to be the "external" header file. Don't give away any
  internals here!

  This document presents a mixture of ideas from at least:
  - Daniel Stenberg
  - Steve Dekorte
  - Sterling Hughes
  - Ben Greear

  -------------------------------------------
  GOALS

  o Enable a "pull" interface. The application that uses libcurl decides where
    and when to ask libcurl to get/send data.

  o Enable multiple simultaneous transfers without using threads or making it
    very complicated for the application.

  o Enable the application to select() on its own file descriptors and curl's
    file descriptors simultaneous easily.
  
  Example source using this interface: http://curl.haxx.se/dev/multi-app.c

 *          time, until a special "end of msgs" struct is returned as a signal
 *          that there is no more to get at this point.
 *
 *          curl_multi_info_close() should be called when the last info has
