                     Source Code Functions Apps Might Use
                     ====================================

The libcurl source code offers a few functions by source only. They are not
part of the official libcurl API, but the source files might be useful for
others so apps can optionally compile/build with these sources to gain
additional functions.


strtoofft.[ch]
==============

 curlx_strtoofft()

   A macro that converts a string containing a number to a curl_off_t number.
   This might use the curlx_strtoll() function which is provided as source
   code in strtoofft.c. Note that the function is only provided if no
   strtoll() (or equivalent) function exist on your platform. If curl_off_t
   is only a 32 bit number on your platform, this macro uses strtol().

timeval.[ch]
============

 Provides a 'struct timeval' for platforms that don't have one already, and
 includes the proper include files for those that have one. Using this will
 make the output require the 'winmm' lib on Windows (unless WITHOUT_MM_LIB
 is defined at compile-time).

 curlx_tvnow()

   returns a struct timeval for the current time.

 curlx_tvdiff()

   returns the difference between two timeval structs, in number of
   milliseconds.
