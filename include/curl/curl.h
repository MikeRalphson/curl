 *
 * A session should be looked upon as a series of requests to a single host.  A
 * session interacts with one host only, using one single protocol.
 *
 * The URL is not required. If set to "" or NULL, it can still be set later
 * using the curl_setopt() function. If the curl_connect() function is called
 * without the URL being known, it will return error.
 *
 * EXAMPLE
 *

 * by curl_open().

 * DESCRIPTION

 * specify a document, it will use the one set previously)

 * This function asks for the particular document, file or resource that
 * resides on the server we have connected to. You may specify a full URL,
 * just an absolute path or even a relative path. That means, if you're just
 * getting one file from the remote site, you can use the same URL as input
 * for both curl_open() as well as for this function.
 *
 * In the even there is a host name, port number, user name or password parts
 * in the URL, you can use the 'flags' argument to ignore them completely, or
 * at your choice, make the function fail if you're trying to get a URL from
 * different host than you connected to with curl_connect().
 *
 * You can only get one document at a time using the same connection. When one
 * document has been received you can although request again.
 *
 * When the transfer is done, curl_done() MUST be called.
 *
 * EXAMPLE
 *
 * CURLCode result;
 * char *url;
 * CURLconnect *connect;
 * result = curl_do(connect, url, CURL_DO_NONE); */
