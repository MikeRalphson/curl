 * getting one file from the remote site, you can use the same URL as input
 * for both curl_open() as well as for this function.

 * in the URL, you can use the 'flags' argument to ignore them completely, or
 * at your choice, make the function fail if you're trying to get a URL from
 * different host than you connected to with curl_connect().
 *
 * You can only get one document at a time using the same connection. When one
 * document has been received you can although request again.
 *
 * When the transfer is done, curl_done() MUST be called.

 *
 * CURLCode result;

 * CURLconnect *connect;
 * result = curl_do(connect, url, CURL_DO_NONE); */
