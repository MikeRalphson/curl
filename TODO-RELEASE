======================

6. REST fix for servers not behaving well on >2GB requests. This should fail
   if the server doesn't set the pointer to the requested index. The tricky
   part is to figure out if the server did the right thing or not.

21. Send QUIT before closing an FTP connection. Joe Halpin works on this.

23. Peter Sylvester's "Most Significant Common Name" patch. Feedback welcome.
    At least the UTF8 conversion and comparison should be done. Patch?

24. When using ares, create the ares channel in the curl_easy_init function
    and re-use the same channel during the life time of the curl handle.

25. Curl_strtoll() is not part of the libcurl API, yet 'curl' needs a function
    like this. We need to sort out how to deal with it. I really don't like
    adding non-transfer related functions to the API. Is there a downside with
    putting such files in a common dir for functions/code that can be used by
    both the lib and the client code? Other functions that could be treated
    the same way include the *printf and the string comparison functions etc.
    Daniel's task. Comments welcome!

26. Make it possible to share the ares channel with the share interface.

To get fixed in 7.11.2 (planned release May/June 2004)
======================

1. Introduce a new error code indicating authentication problems (for proxy
   CONNECT error 407 for example). This cannot be an error code, we must not
   return informational stuff as errors, consider a new info returned by
   curl_easy_getinfo() #845941 UNASSIGNED
