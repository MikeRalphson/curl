To be addressed before 7.19.1 (planned release: October/November 2008)
=============================

162 - Craig Perras' note "http upload: how to stop on error"
      http://curl.haxx.se/mail/archive-2008-08/0138.html

165 - "Problem with CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM and CURLOPT_APPEND" by Daniele Pinau,
      recipe: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2008-08/0439.html

166 - Cookies with bad expiry date treated as session cookies (and thus wrongly
      matches and get sent)

167 - pipelining with proxy hangs

168 - curl_easy_pause bugs

169 - curl crash when using sftp with socks. We need a Curl_plain_read() to
      use for the SOCKS code in the same style I made the Curl_plain_write()
      before.

170 - Two small items of interest for the webpage
      two mistakes in the curl.1 man page

171 - [PATCH] add some locking for thread-safety to NSS implementation
