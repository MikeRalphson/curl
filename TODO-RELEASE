To get fixed in 7.11.2 (planned release late April/early May 2004)
======================

36. autobuild test failures on Tru64/IRIX (test case 88 for example)

   The problem is once again (this is the same scenario we had before in the
   notorious test case 91 failure bug hunt) that when doing a second request,
   the client hasn't yet found out that the previous connection is on its way
   to get closed. It then re-uses the connection only to find it closed right
   away.

   We have code starting at lib/transfer.c:1949 that is supposed to detect
   this situation and enforce a retry. This retry never happens on these
   failures, indicating that the check is bad or that some code has ruined the
   values used in the check.


To get fixed in 7.12.0 (no date)
======================

25. curl_easy_strerror() curl_multi_strerror() curl_share_strerror()
    Code already in CVS. Messages need overview/improvements.
    Medium prio.

26. i18n of error messages?
    Low prio. Nobody has volunteered. Subject for removal.

33. Add a function to replace the malloc-calls within libcurl.
    Low prio. Seshubabu Pasam works on this.

35. Rearrange lib/hostip.c to reduce the amount of #ifdefs and make it easier
    to follow "the flow".
    Medium prio.
