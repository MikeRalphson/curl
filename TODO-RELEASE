To be addressed before 7.19.0 (planned release: August 2008)
=============================

144 - Help apps use 64bit/LFS libcurl!
      64-bit curl_off_t no longer gated to off_t patch already committed.
      TODO:
       * Test it on the broadest combination of platforms and compilers.
       * Old logic based on CURL_SIZEOF_CURL_OFF_T, ENABLE_64BIT, HAVE_LONGLONG,
         has to be revisited and adjusted as appropriate.
       * Enabling and disabling of large file support needs further inspection.
