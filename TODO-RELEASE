Issues not sorted in any particular order.

To get fixed in 7.12.3 (planned release: December 2004)
======================

47 - Peter Sylvester's patch for SRP on the TLS layer
     Awaits OpenSSL support for this, no need to support this in libcurl before
     there's an OpenSSL release that does it.

48 - MSVC Makefile improvements by Samuel Díaz García
     Still lacks user feedback. Possibly not going to get in.

51 - PUT/POST with multipass authenticaion
     Daniel works on this.
