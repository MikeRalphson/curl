Fix before releasing 7.11.0
===========================
(Issues not sorted in any particular order)

8. Resolve the occational test case 91 failure. This still has no
   resolution. (David Byron has done lots of research, no resolution yet)

12. The "PUT and (NTLM/Digest) auth" bug (test-patch posted, awaiting
    feedback/response) #862835

19. Resolve Giuseppe Attardi's "elusive cache bug" (work in progress)

To get fixed in 7.11.1
======================

1. Introduce a new error code indicating authentication problems (for proxy
   CONNECT error 407 for example) (no progress yet) #845941

2. Make the proxy CONNECT headers get passed to the callbacks just like other
   headers are (no progress yet) #845941

4. Multi-threaded OpenSSL usage needs to be addressed (patch anyone?)

6. REST fix for servers not behaving well on >2GB requests (some outstanding
   issues, Dave Meyer works on this)

9. Modify ares to do 'files bind' order instead of 'bind files' by default
   (not actually part of libcurl) See details by Frank Ticheler posted here:
   http://curl.haxx.se/mail/archive-2003-11/0020.html

10. Anton Fedorov's "dumpcert" patch (only mailed to me privately)

14. Evaluate/apply Gertjan van Wingerde's SSL patches

16. Tony Blakie's bug report about getting a 302 and Location: back from a
    proxy after a CONNECT request. (correct behavior on this is not certain)

18. Modified Accept: header in the default HTTP request (being discussed)

20. Directory listing support for file:///dir/ (patch by David Hull)
    http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=844036&group_id=976&atid=300976
    This patch needs work to become portable.

21. Send QUIT before closing an FTP connection. Joe Halpin has volunteered
    to provide a patch.

22. Dan Fandrich's improvement for easier building with the compressed manual.
