To be addressed before 7.19.0 (planned release: August 2008)
=============================

144 - Help apps use 64bit/LFS libcurl!
      64-bit curl_off_t no longer gated to off_t patch already committed.
      TODO:
       * Test it on the broadest combination of platforms and compilers.
       * Old logic based on CURL_SIZEOF_CURL_OFF_T, still needs some adjusting.
       * Enabling and disabling of large file support needs further inspection.
       * Test case 557 must pass on all autobuilds.
       * System off_t, or equivalent, size must be recorded in curlbuild.h
