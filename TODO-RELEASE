Issues not sorted in any particular order.

To get fixed in 7.13.2 (planned release: April 2005)
======================

58 - Fix KNOWN_BUGS #19: "FTP 3rd party transfers with the multi interface
     doesn't work"

47 - Peter Sylvester's patch for SRP on the TLS layer
     Awaits OpenSSL support for this, no need to support this in libcurl before
     there's an OpenSSL release that does it.

To get fixed in 7.14.0
======================

55 - Add a function to the multi interface that gets file descriptors, as an
     alternative to the curl_multi_fdset(). This is necessary to allow apps to
     properly avoid the FD_SETSIZE problem.

56 - Make curl_easy_perform() a wrapper-function that simply creates a multi
     handle, adds the easy handle to it, runs curl_multi_perform() until the
     transfer is done, then detach the easy handle, destroy the multi handle
     and return the easy handle's return code. This will thus make everything
     internally use and assume the multi interface. The select()-loop should
     use the new function from (55).

57 - Add an interface to libcurl for getting and setting cookies from an easy
     handle. One idea: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2004-12/0195.html the
     older idea: http://curl.haxx.se/dev/COOKIES. We need to settle on some
     middle ground I guess.
