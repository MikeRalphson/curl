To get fixed in 7.12.0 (planned release: June 2004)
======================

25. curl_easy_strerror() curl_multi_strerror() curl_share_strerror() Code
    already in CVS. Messages need overview/improvements. Add documentation.
    Medium prio.

33. Add a function to replace the malloc-calls within libcurl.
    Low prio. Seshubabu Pasam works on this.

37. Translate to/from ACE encoded domain names as needed.
    Work has started. Verify. Add test cases.

38. Make the ldap protocol work with Windows' built-in LDAP-client.
    I.e. dynamically link to WLDAP32.DLL and add ldap URL parsing
    (WLDAP32.DLL doesn't have an UTF-8 ldap_url_parse).
