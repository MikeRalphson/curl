146 - Yehoshua Hershberg's re-using of connections that failed with
      CURLE_PEER_FAILED_VERIFICATION

148 - Introduction of m4/reentrant.m4 is triggering some problems on Solaris
      systems. The problem manifests when buildconf runs aclocal, at some point
      aclocal fails when using GNU m4 version 1.4.5 it runs out of memory.  If
      GNU m4 version 1.4.11 is used everything works.  Lots of tests have been
      done which have allowed to discard many possible pitfalls on our side.
      As of right now my main suspect is which 'sed' binary is being used by
      aclocal, if it is a broken sed, aclocal might be feeding garbage to m4.
      As a consecuence of al this tries and tests the inclusion method of
      m4/reentrant.m4 has been changed several times, and should finally be
      changed back to the proper '-I m4' method which was used initially and
      that didn't fail on other systems.

      UPDATE:
       * sed cannot be the culprit aclocal and autom4te are perl scripts and
         don't use 'sed'.
       * autom4te matches autoconf version and aclocal matches automake's.
       * Even when directly copying into acinclude.m4 the contents of file
         reentrant.m4 and having the '-I m4' thing disabled the problem
         persists.
       * Reinstated the 'aclocal -I m4' in buildconf and 'ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS =
         -I m4' way of including our local m4/reentrant.m4 file. This even
         takes care of including the file in the distribution tarball.

150 - PUT with -C - sends garbage in the Content-Range: header (test case 1041)

151 - PUT with -L hangs after receiving a redirect (test case 1051, but the
      test harness has a problem with this, too)
