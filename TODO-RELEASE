To get fixed in 7.12.0 (planned release: June 2004)
======================

33. Add a function to replace the malloc-calls within libcurl.
    Low prio. Seshubabu Pasam works on this?

38. Make the ldap protocol work with Windows' built-in LDAP-client.
    I.e. dynamically link to WLDAP32.DLL and add ldap URL parsing
    (WLDAP32.DLL doesn't have an UTF-8 ldap_url_parse).
    Low prio. A Gisle Vanem job!
