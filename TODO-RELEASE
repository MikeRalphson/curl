To be addressed before 7.18.1 (planned release: April 2008)
=============================

118 - Gautam Kachroo's issue with proxies and ssl, when libcurl uses SSL even
      though not really in a state for it. The patch breaks test case 509, but
      it also seems the test 509 already is more or less broken before this
      patch because it never completes the asynch openssl handshake as it
      should. The most recent patch in here:
      http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2008-01/0323.html

119 - Christian Buchner's mentioned race condition in win32 gethostbyname_thread
      http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2008-02/0000.html

120 - Removal / updating of the ca-bundle

      http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1889593

121 - Kaspar Brand's and Guenter Knauf's work on the TLS extension Server Name
      Indication (RFC 4366) http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2008-02/0050.html

122 - Progress callback not called during failed socket connect with the multi
      interface as reported in the bug #1891355:
