To get fixed in 7.11.2 (planned release May/June 2004)
======================

31. Fix multi interface for windows with ares. curl_multi_fdset() returns
    blank fdsets during name lookup which causes a following select() to fail!
    High prio.

35. Rearrange lib/hostip.c to reduce the amount of #ifdefs and make it easier
    to follow "the flow". Daniel's task.
    Medium prio.

36. Make sure most of the windows builds work after issue 35.

To get fixed in 7.12.0
======================

25. curl_easy_strerror() curl_multi_strerror() curl_share_strerror()
    Code already in CVS. Messages need overview/improvements.
    Medium prio.

26. i18n of error messages?
    Low prio. Nobody has volunteered. Subject for removal.

33. Add a function to replace the malloc-calls within libcurl.
    Low prio. Seshubabu Pasam works on this.
