146 - Yehoshua Hershberg's re-using of connections that failed with
      CURLE_PEER_FAILED_VERIFICATION

148 - Introduction of m4/reentrant.m4 is triggering some problems on Solaris
      systems. The problem manifests when buildconf runs aclocal, at some point
      aclocal fails when using GNU m4 version 1.4.5 it runs out of memory.  If
      GNU m4 version 1.4.11 is used everything works.

      UPDATE:
       * Rebooting the problematic system, releasing allocated memory and swap,
         has allowed buildconf and configure to complete sucessfully. Further
         tests on the system might allow determination of the problem origin.
         Solaris AutoBuilds suceeded on August 2 and 3.
