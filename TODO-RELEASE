=============================

157 - the CERTINFO patch as posted to:
      http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2008-08/0105.html

158 - Martin Drasar's CURLOPT_POSTREDIR work:
      http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2008-08/0170.html

161 - test case 1065 failure (HTTP PUT with one file but two URLs)
      http://curl.haxx.se/mail/archive-2008-08/0075.html

162 - Craig Perras' note "http upload: how to stop on error"
      http://curl.haxx.se/mail/archive-2008-08/0138.html Most possibly this is
      also closely related to the bug "race condition while POSTing to
      HTTP/1.0 servers" => http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2080222
