A special thanks to:

 archivas.com and Alan Pinstein, for paying me to focus on their requests

This release includes the following changes:

 o added ability to "upload" to file:// URLs
 o added curl_global_init_mem()
 o removed curl_formparse()
 o the MSVC project file in the release archive is automatically built
 o curl --proxy-digest is a new command line option
 o the Windows version of libcurl can use wldap32.dll for LDAP
 o added curl_easy_strerror(), curl_multi_strerror() and curl_share_strerror()
 o IPv6-enabled Windows hosts now resolves names threaded/asynch as well
 o configure --with-libidn can be used to point out the root dir of a libidn
   installation (version 0.4.5 or later) for curl to use, then libcurl can
   resolve and use IDNA names (domain names with "international" letters)

This release includes the following bugfixes:

 o incoming cookies with domains set with a prefixed dot now works better
 o CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE and CURLOPT_COOKIE can be used in the same request

   (which is as high a signed 64 bit number can reach)

 o mulipart formposting with -F and file names with spaces work again
 o curl_easy_duphandle() now works when ares-enabled
 o HTTP Digest authentication works a lot more like the RFC says
 o curl works with telnet and stdin properly on Windows
 o configure --without-ssl works even when pkg-config has OpenSSL details
 o src/hugehelp.c builds correct again in non-configure build environments
