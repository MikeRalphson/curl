Curl and libcurl 7.11.0. A minor features added release.

The 78th public curl release. Release number 105 counted from the very
beginning.

This release includes the following changes:

 o CURLOPT_FTPSSL and ftps:// now do ssl over FTP "The Right Way" (the curl
   tool now features the --ftp-ssl option)
 o The Windows DLLs are built with an added "resource file"
 o New LIBCURL_VERSION_* defines for easier checking version number
 o Included Mac OS X 'framework' makefile in the release archive
 o Removed the TRUE and FALSE #defines from the public curl header file
 o Added CURLOPT_NETRC_FILE

This release includes the following bugfixes:

 o POST over proxy to https server failed
 o improved how libcurl deals with persistant connections over FTP when a
   transfer fails
 o accessing a proxy that requires Basic auth without password caused a hang
 o a free free-twice problem in the server certificate code
 o minor memory leak when using ranges on persistant connections
 o formpost parts sending files with .html extensions now use "Content-Type: 
   text/html"
 o formpost parts now default to "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"
 o --progress-bar was slightly improved
 o Failing to connect to localhost, using the multi interface on Solaris
   showed a connect problem now fixed.
 o The generated ca-bundle.h file is now generated in the build dir, not the
   source dir
 o The FTP-EPSV response parser for the 229 code was fixed
 o curl finds the user's home dir slightly different and hopefully better on
   Windows
 o testcurl.sh can now be used to autotest daily tarballs
 o a couple of command line options now check that the underyling library
   actually supports the features before trying to enable them
 o uninitialized variable fix
 o better html versions of the man pages

Other curl-related news since the previous public release:

 o pycURL 7.10.8 was released: http://pycurl.sf.net/
