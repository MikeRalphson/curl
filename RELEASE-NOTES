Other curl-related news since the previous public release:

 o http://curl.freemirror.de/ is a new German mirror
 o All curl relatd mailing list information and subscribers on cool.haxx.se
   were lost due to a malicious user exploiting a security hole on the
   server. Attempts have been made to put back susbcribers on the lists, but
   many have been lost: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lost.html
 o New S-Lang binding: http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/slang/
 o TclCurl 0.14.1: http://personal1.iddeo.es/andresgarci/tclcurl/english/

This release would not have looked like this without help, code, reports and
advice from friends like these:

   David Yan, Michael Wallner, Domenico Andreoli, Darryl House
