Curl and libcurl 7.11.1. A bugfix release.

The 79th public curl release. Release number 106 counted from the very
beginning.

This release includes the following changes:

 o curl --socks can be used to set a SOCKS5 proxy to use
 o response-headers received after a (proxy) CONNECT request are now passd
   to the header callback just like other headers

This release includes the following bugfixes:

 o fixed the unconditional #include of config.h in hugehelp.c
 o builds fine on MPE/iX
 o upload using chunked transfer-encoding now sends the last chunk properly
   teriminated with an extra CRLF
 o Fixed the progress meter display for files >2GB
 o persistant connections over a proxy messed up the proxy name/password
 o the socks5 code segfaulted if no username/password was set
 o the *_LARGE options now take curl_off_t types as parameters and this will
   make it possible to handle large files on windows too

Other curl-related news since the previous public release:

This release would not have looked like this without help, code, reports and
advice from friends like these:

 Gisle Vanem, Vincent Bronner, Richard Bramante, Dirk Manske, Dan Fandrich,
 Ken Hirsch, Stadler Stephan

        Thanks! (and sorry if I forgot to mention someone)
